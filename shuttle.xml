	<description>The Rendelli StarDrive Model 805R cargo shuttle is perhaps the least glamorous, but also the most versatile, of all starships. Its diminutive size and low cost make it popular with the smaller shipping firms and charter services, and it makes a good courier ship as well. Its boxy appearance belies its rugged and durable construction. This sturdy little vessel is found virtually everywhere in the galaxy.<description>
