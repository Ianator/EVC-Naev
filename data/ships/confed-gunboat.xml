	<description>The Terran Naval Yards G-564 missile gunboat is essentially a stretched model of its cousin, the P-361 patrol fighter. As an outgrowth of the earlier P-361 design program, the gunboat's designers were able to keep the parts commonly used between the two ships; for example, the gunboat' unique tri-mounted wings are identical to the assemblies used by the patrol ship. The forwarded-mounted strakes along the fuselage sides hold missile racks and rocket launchers.</description>
