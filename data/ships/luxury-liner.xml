	<description>Centauri Spacelines operates its custom-built luxury liners between all of the Core Worlds. For the price of a ticket, which is literally astronomical, you get six days and nights of blissful relaxation aboard what has been called "the most decadent thing ever to leave drydock." A gourmet chef and an eager crew are always at your disposal, and, if you're a member of the aristocracy, so are the pretty young flight attendants who see to the wealthy's "special" desires.</description>
