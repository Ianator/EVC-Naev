	<description>If you're looking to get your large cargo to its destination as quickly as possible, look no further than the Metroworks V7 courier. It is essentially nothing more than a triad of large engines with a cargo bay and a life-support pod attached. A testament to this ship's high speed, long range, and great reliability is the fact that Starbound Express uses them for nearly 95% of its domestic cargo routes.</description>
