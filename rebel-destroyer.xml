	<description>When a team of defecting engineers from CDX Starworks approached the Rebel High Command with a unique proposal, the Rebel destroyer was born. Because of the fact that it is essentially a CDX Argosy with extra armor, uprated engines, and gun turrets, the destroyer is cheap to mass-produce. However, because it is still a freighter at heart, its performance is not up to the level of the Confederate frigate or the Atinoda Kestrel. Still, it remains an important part of the Rebel fleet.</description>
