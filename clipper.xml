	<description>Aerostar Space Industries' assembly lines are mainly devoted to producing starship subassemblies for other manufacturers, but their C-35 Star Clipper Mk. IV is their most widely-recognized product. This sleek, delta-winged ship is a combination courier vessel and light warship, and excels in both roles. Its offensive and defensive capabilities are quite good for a ship of its size, and it has ample room for expansion that allows it to be turned into either a top-flight cargo hauler or an outstanding heavy fighter.</description>
