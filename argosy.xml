	<description>CDX Starworks is a relatively new player in the cargo-ship market, having previously established its reputation building fighters. Its Argosy-class light freighter has already become quite popular with shipping companies operating near the edge of Confederation space, because of its advantages over the AS129 in the areas of speed, maneuverability, and firepower. Its only real liabilities are its higher price and slightly smaller cargo capacity.</description>
