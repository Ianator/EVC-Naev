	<description>The Maskirovka IPV-1 Corvette is a hard ship to classify - its maneuverability and acceleration make it perform like a heavy fighter, but it is armed like a light capital ship. Maskirovka builds the Corvette to fill the gap in the commercial starship market between the classical starfighters and the super-powerful Atinoda Kestrel. The Corvette has been popular with corporate governments who need to police their space, as it makes an excellent customs and patrol vessel.</description>
